Cannabis enjoys a reputation for being a sort of cuddly, easy-to-treat-casually drug among its users and non-users alike. It is indebted to the fact that many go through a phase of vape-hits, bong-rips, and chewable gummies throughout their teens and twenties, only to moderate or abandon the drug altogether at the onset of life’s real responsibilities. This is undeserved. For me and many others, it is a substance that is prone to abuse and catastrophic psychological fallout. Its embrace is acidic: warm at first, but damn if it isn’t painful after a while.

It is because of cannabis that I have had two multi-week stays in psych wards, believing everyone there was plotting to vivisect me. I have torn up the linoleum floors of one of my psych ward rooms, looking for hidden messages underneath. I have thought things so alien and disturbing, so non-native to my mind, that I came to believe that my COVID-19 vaccination also contained microscopic machines that invaded and rewired my brain. I have lied repeatedly to those closest to me, damaging our relationships in ways that I am still repairing. I have become an other to myself. And I have tried to escape all my drug-induced madness by taking my own life via overdose of blood-pressure-lowering beta-blockers.

Having done these things because of cannabis, and yet finding prohibition to be unfavorable due to the harshness of the penalties imposed on the convicted, I find myself in the uncomfortable position of wishing it were federally legal while being terrified of the consequences that the sunsetting of its taboo will have for the psychologically vulnerable. One wishes that education and mental health screening were enough to address the cannabis question, but all must be familiar with the ease with which one can ignore warning signs in the pursuit of sensory gratification. I certainly did. So please consider my disclosure here as a mild warning. Be careful; it can sneak up on you.

But so it is to my episodes of despair that I owe both a new desire for a more rigid moral framework than could be provided by mere cultural osmosis and a new understanding of the anxiolytic effects of prayer and meditation. Many of the non-religious behave in an effortlessly saint-like manner. It is for this reason that in pursuing my substance of choice over everything — including core values like honesty and integrity — I cannot say that atheism was the cause of my troubles. But the saintly atheists are exceptional, a fact which must simply be attributable to superior psychological makeup. Most would benefit from engaging with the concept of a higher power, and I can no longer count myself as being outside that majority.

Had I been asked at nearly any point during the past fifteen years if I were religious, I would have answered resolutely in the negative; being an atheist and an anti-theist was core to my identity, and I would not have let the opportunity pass to expound of various arguments against God and religion, arguments which were first made by better atheists than me and which still are, even now, dear to my heart. Even during my experimental sojourns in the beautiful and chaotic worlds of LSD and psilocybin — where patterns emerge everywhere and interweave and dance and breath, and where one becomes overwhelmed by the beauty and meaning in ordinary, small-in-the-grand-scheme things — experiences of the numinous were rare, and even at their heights nothing was felt beyond a sense of pure marvel at the hallucinations, the time-warps, and the intense appreciation for art of all kinds that these drugs reliably produce.

But now, having run aground on the continent of my own moral inadequacy, I must say that I have become a more religious person, albeit one who disbelieves the miracles and the Resurrection and who cannot bring himself not to ultimately be agnostic as to whether God exists, anyway, the question seeming to me to be kind of moot, with God thankfully having not revealed Himself and with all of religions positive effects — the existence of which I would previously have argued against — seeming to operate without any such revelation being necessary. Prayer and the story of Christ have become important. Meditation and the Middle Path have become important. And these things’ becoming important has begotten a turning within me from an atheist worldview to a more-so-but-not-quite-fully-religious one, on the basis of which I feel utterly comfortable with calling myself both Christian and Buddhist, despite the apparent contradiction and even if an ultimate, literal belief proves impossible.

This turn I have talked toward religion was not the result of any reevaluation of scriptural claims to historicity. It remains obvious that any truth once represented by our religious texts has long since been obscured by mutation and embellishment, a process that owes its drive to man’s tendency to manipulate the truth, whether consciously or not. Our religions are full of lies. The miracles and the Resurrection did not occur. There is no such thing as spiritual enlightenment.

But these are useful lies. It is precisely our tendency to manipulate the truth that has delivered to us a set of world religions whose beliefs and practices have such a high degree of psychological potency. People repeat those aspects of a story or practice that are most gripping and effective, and this happens iteratively, generation after generation, the result of which is an evolutionary process that appears to be aiming for salience in the same way that biological evolution appears to be aiming for fitness. From this we can conclude that our oldest myths and traditions contain the very highest degree of psychological salience. They are the most captivating. They are the most useful.

This line of thinking became meaningful to me only after I was forced to abandon pure atheism and start to flirt with what religion has to offer. Upon experiencing my traumatic drug addiction and withdrawals, I had to stop prizing ultimate truth in order to fix something in me that I had damaged in pursuit of material pleasure. As I suffered through psychotic withdrawals, the positive effects of prayer and meditation became undeniable.

We, the people who require a God, do so because we fail in confrontation with the multiplicity of outcomes that arise from any moral decision, and by having a dialog with a hypothetical higher power we are aided in navigating this complexity. From each moral decision stems a cascade of consequences, each requiring yet more decisions and yielding yet more consequences, etc., the final results of which we are only dimly aware. The saintly atheist has no problem choosing the actions that beget the best of outcomes. However, I as a pure atheist did not elicit the best outcomes — not by any means.

I have a tendency to get wrapped up in my own mind and to be not cruel but indifferent toward others. I isolate and I push away. Religion is an antidote to this inadequacy. It must be familiar to all that one tends to behave differently when alone and with different people. Observers affect our behavior in accordance with the characteristics of those observers, and so for those of us who do better with religion our lives, we must owe it to the imposition of constant, ultimately moral observer called God.

To be clear, this is not a presence I actually feel. It is not real to me in the same way an object or another person are. God is simply a hypothetical entity with which to have an always-one-sided moral dialog, not real, but real enough as a concept to get the job done. And this serves both to maintain the illusion of God’s presence and to make moral reasoning linguistic and therefore explicit. It pulls from pre-linguistic, liminal consciousness the elements of our moral thinking that eventually become actions. And so by describing one’s actions and desires to God during prayer, they take on a starker definition that leaves them more open to scrutiny. This is an aid to the habitually amoral.

I have so far said nothing of why I have chosen Christianity and the Abrahamic God as the anchors of my moral worldview. The truth of it is that this choice was made for me when I was born into a Western culture with Christian moral underpinnings. To the extent that I am educated about Christ's example, I find that it comports well with what goodness already means to me, and this is undoubtedly due to the Christian cultural context of my upbringing. What of the other world religions? If I imagine myself to have been born into a Hindu or Muslim context, I cannot help but think that I would turn to some aspect of those religions when the interactions of my genes with my environment would inevitably have led me to similar crises as those that made me turn to Christian ideas. I make no claim for the superiority of Christianity, and I would advise anyone in a place of desperation to turn to whichever religion or spiritual system is most salient to them.

In fact — and despite my wholly Western upbringing — there are aspects of Buddhism that have proven useful to me during my crises. I am referring to what is in the West popularly called mindfulness meditation and to the Buddhist concept of the Middle Path; meditation being a practice that has anxiolytic, mind-mending effects in common with prayer because both are a deliberate exercise that involves training one's attention on something material — what is more vital and grounding than our breath and voice? — and the Middle Path being the idea that one should act in accordance with the idea of living in the area between asceticism and sensory gratification. But just as with prayer and God-as-a-concept, I do not find it necessary to hold any ultimate beliefs about Buddhist enlightenment in order to receive benefit from this practice. I only need to interact with whichever are the most salient and useful concepts the religion provides.

Given this endorsement of other spiritualisms and my commitment to an agnostic posture toward religion, it may seem that my beliefs are weak. And it is true that I developed this argument exactly for the purposes of benefiting from religious ideas and practices while assuaging the rebellion of my atheistic heart, wanting always to have my cake and eat it too. But all this entails is that there are two kinds of belief, that of ultimate truth and that of practical utility. These ways of believing can — and always do — occur within the same person. Does God exist? Is there such a thing as spiritual enlightenment? Can't claim to know.

But these concepts have become undeniable, no profound spiritual experience required. They have benefits that the desperate cannot afford to deny, if they are willing to go through the mere motions of doing something that doesn't quite make sense. Why hold a conversation with something that isn't there? And why sit and concentrate only on your breath for half an hour each day? It doesn't matter; it works, and we can at once sift through religions' offerings — searching not for absolution or a ticket to heaven but for those gem ideas that can truly help us in times of need — while also reserving judgement about the ultimate truth in an attitude of humility and grace.

Even after recovery from the drug-induced psychosis and a rehab stint and my indecisive soul-searching, sobriety remains a difficult, one-day-at-a-time effort. I am committed, but commitment is weak to the addict's impulsivity. It remains unclear whether sobriety is maintainable and that unclarity will remain with me for the rest of my life. Such is the fog of war. But there are aids available, psychological tools derived from our most ancient spiritualisms which point the way. All that remains is to pay attention to them.
